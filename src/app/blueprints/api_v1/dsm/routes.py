"""
Mock DSM Blueprint Routes (Recruiter Sample)

These routes are representative examples of the API design and coding style
used in the full PsychoDiagnose project. To protect proprietary and sensitive
domain content:
- Only a subset of the original routes is included.
- Some logic and data have been simplified or replaced with mock data.
- Certain domain-specific details have been modified or omitted.

Goal: demonstrate structure/patterns (versioning, pagination, validation,
error handling, relationship serialization) without exposing full production code.
