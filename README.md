## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About PsychoDiagnose

PsychoDiagnose is an **educational web application** that guides psychology and psychiatry students through the structured diagnostic process for mental disorders, based on the **DSM-5-TR** (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision).

It is designed to:
- Provide an **interactive learning tool** for navigating diagnostic categories, disorders, signs, symptoms, and steps.
- Support **critical thinking** and academic learning without issuing medical diagnoses.
- Offer a **responsive, accessible, and intuitive interface**.

---

## ‚ú® Motivation

As a psychology student, I often struggled with the complexity of the **DSM** and wished for a tool that made the process easier to understand.  
PsychoDiagnose was built to **simplify learning** for students and professionals, helping them:
- Explore diagnostic criteria step-by-step
- Understand relationships between disorders, signs, and symptoms
- Practice applying structured reasoning in a safe, educational context
